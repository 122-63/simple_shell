#SIMPLE SHELL

## DESCRIPTION

This project is done in order to test all the knowledge obtained throughout the
program, we must make our own shell reader and understand in depth all the
processes that are executed when you give a command to the terminal.

## CONTENT

The files included in our repository that make our program work are:

* _shell.c
* _dot.
* _env.c
* _execute.nb.c
* _execute.c
* _exit.c
* _getenv.c
* _strcat.c
* _strcmp.c
* _strdup.c
* shell.h
* split_string.c

## HOW IT WORKS
For our program to work properly you must: receive an instruction (command)
read command run it if correct show error message to be the opposite

### EXAMPLE

## IMPORTANT

As we are creating functions because we have requirements to fulfill, these
functions are included in a header file called shell.h, without this file the
program will not compile as it should not recognize the functions created.

## NOTES
Currently our program can read and execute commands interactively and
non-interactively.
